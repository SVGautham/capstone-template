# Overview of MAT496

In this course, we have primarily learned Langgraph. This is helpful tool to build apps which can process unstructured `text`, find information we are looking for, and present the format we choose. Some specific topics we have covered are:

- Prompting
- Structured Output 
- Semantic Search
- Retreaval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Tool calling LLMs & MCP
- Langgraph: State, Nodes, Graph

We also learned that Langsmith is a nice tool for debugging Langgraph codes.

# Capstone Project objective

The objective of this project is to apply advanced concepts from LangGraph—such as state management, memory, multi-agent collaboration, and iterative LLM reasoning—to build an AI-driven system capable of evaluating how closely a resume matches a job description. As a final-year engineering student preparing for placements, this project demonstrates my ability to work with cutting-edge AI frameworks, build end-to-end agentic workflows, and develop solutions that bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and real recruitment challenges.

# Added instructions:

- This is a `solo assignment`. Each of you will work alone. You are free to talk, discuss with chatgpt, but you are responsible for what you submit. Some students may be called for viva. You should be able to each and every line of work submitted by you.

- `commit` History maintenance.
  - Fork this respository and build on top of that.
  - For every step in your plan, there has to be a commit.
  - Change [TODO] to [DONE] in the plan, before you commit after that step. 
  - The commit history should show decent amount of work spread into minimum two dates. 
  - **All the commits done in one day will be rejected**. Even if you are capable of doing the whole thing in one day, refine it in two days.  
 
 - Deadline: Nov 30, Sunday 11:59 pm
